[#upgrading-by-using-the-operator]
= Upgrading {product-title}

You control your {product-title} upgrades by using the operator subscription settings in the {ocp} console. When you initially deploy {product-title-short} by using the operator, you make the following selections:

* *Channel:* Channel corresponds to the version of the product that you are installing. The initial channel setting is often the most current channel that was available at the time of installation. 

* *Approval:* Approval specifies whether approval is required for updates within the channel, or if they are done automatically. 

+
- If set to `Automatic`, then minor release updates in the selected channel are deployed without administrator intervention. 
+
- If set to `Manual`, then each update to the minor release within the channel requires an administrator to approve the update. 

*Required access:* {ocp-short} administrator

You also use these settings when you upgrade {product-title-short} by using the operator. Complete the following steps to upgrade your operator:

**Important:** You cannot revert back to an earlier version after upgrading to a later version in the channel selection. You must uninstall the operator and reinstall it with the earlier version to use a previous version.

. Log in to your {ocp-short} operator hub.

. In the {ocp-short} navigation, select *Operators* > *Installed operators*.

. Select the *{product-title}* operator.

. Select the _Subscription_ tab to edit the subscription settings.

. Ensure that the _Upgrade Status_ is labeled _Up to date_. This status indicates that the operator is at the latest level that is available in the selected channel. If the _Upgrade Status_ indicates that there is an upgrade pending, complete the following steps to update it to the latest minor release that is available in the channel:

.. Click the *Manual* setting in the _Approval_ field to edit the value. 

.. Select *Automatic* to enable automatic updates. 

.. Select *Save* to commit your change. 

.. Wait for the automatic updates to be applied to the operator. The updates automatically add the required updates to the latest version in the selected channel. When all of the updated updates are complete, the _Upgrade Status_ field indicates *Up to date*.
+
*Tip:* It can take up to 10 minutes for the `MultiClusterHub` custom resource to finish upgrading. You can check whether the upgrade is still in process by entering the following command:
+
----
oc get mch
----
+
While it is upgrading, the `Status` field shows `Updating`. After upgrading is complete, the `Status` field shows `Running`.

. Now that the _Upgrade Status_ is *Up to date*, click the value in the _Channel_ field to edit it.  

. Select the channel for the next available feature release. *Deprecated:* `release-2.4` and `release-2.3` channels do not receive updates, you must use the `stable-2.0` channel. To import, you must use the `stable-2.0` channel of the klusterlet operator for {product-version}. You cannot skip channels when upgrading. For example, you cannot skip versions 2.2.z through 2.4. 

. Select *Save* to save your changes.

. Wait for the automatic upgrade to complete. After the upgrade to the next feature release completes, the updates to the latest patch releases within the channel are deployed.

. If you have to upgrade to a later feature release, repeat steps 7-9 until your operator is at the latest level of the desired channel. Make sure that all of the patch releases are deployed for your final channel.   

. Optional: You can set your _Approval_ setting to *Manual*, if you want your future updates within the channel to require manual approvals.

{product-title-short} is running at the latest version of the selected channel. 

For more information about upgrading your operator, see https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/operators/index[Operators] in the {ocp-short} documentation.

[#upgrading-clusterpools]
== Managing cluster pools with an upgrade

If you are link:../multicluster_engine/cluster_lifecycle/cluster_pool_manage.adoc#managing-cluster-pools[Managing cluster pools (Technology Preview)], you need further configuration to stop automatic management of these cluster pools after upgrade.

Set `cluster.open-cluster-management.io/createmanagedcluster: "false"` in the `ClusterClaim` metadata.annotations. 

All existing cluster claims are automatically imported when the product is upgraded unless you change this setting.


== Upgrading in a disconnected network environment

As was the case for initial installation, there are special considerations to keep in mind
when upgrading {product-title} in a disconnected network environment.

[#disconnect-upgrading]
=== Considerations when upgrading from release 2.5 or later

During your installation of, upgrade of, {product-title} to release 2.5 or later,
you will have already encountered the need for special consderations related
to the interdependency between the
{product-title} and multicluster engine for Kubernetes operators.
Refer to topic
TODO-need-ref-to-install-file for a details about these installt-ime
special considerations.

Similar considerations continue to apply when upgrading {product-title}.

Please see the following sections for information on things to keep in
mind when preparing to upgrade {product-title}.
We recommend that you satisfy these requirements before you trigger
the upgrade of {product-title} by updating the update
channel in the OLM subscriptino for the {product-title} operator.
Failure to do so may result in a stalled upgrade which could impact
the availability/functioning of {product-title} services.


=== Ensure that required packages are updated in your mirror catalog

During instalaltion (or previous update), you created a mirror catalog and
registry containing operator packages and images needed to install
{product-title} in a disconnected network environment.
In order to upgrade to a new release of {product-title}, you will need to update
your mirror catalog and registry to pick up the updated versions
of the operator packages.

Similar to what was required when initially installing, ensure that your procedures
for updating your mirror catalog and registry include both of the following operator
packagesin the list of operator backges to be included/updated:

* `advanced-cluster-manager`
* `multicluster-engine`

=== Verify your MutliclusterHub resource instance

During instalaltion (or previous update), you created an instance
of the `MulticlusterHub` resource, and due to the disconnected environment,
you added a `mce-subscription-spec` annotation to that resource.

If your procedures for updating your mirror catalog and registry
resulted in the updated catalog being available on the {ocp-short} cluster
via a `CatalogSource` with the same name as previouly used, there should
be no need to update your `MulticlusterHub` resource to update the
`mce-subscriptino-spec` annotation.

On the other hand, if your procedures for updating your mirro catalog and
registry resulted in a new (differently-named) `CatalogSource` being
created, be sure to update the `mce-subscription-spec` annotation in
your `MulticlusterHub` resource to reflect the new catalog source name.


[#disconnect-upgrading-from-24]
=== Considerations when upgrading from release 2.4

{product-title} release 2.5.0 is the first release in which {product-title} uses the
related multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator functionality to provide foundational
services that previously were delivered as part of {product-title} itself.
Releases 2.5 and later of the {product-title} operator will automatically install and manage
the required multicluster engine for Kubernetes operator and `MulticlusterEngine` resource
instance as part of its installation and upgrade of the Hub.

In connected network environments, it is able to do so without any special actions on the part
of the cluster administrator installing or upgrading {product-title}.

However, because installation of any OLM operator in a disconnected environment involves the use of special mirror
catalogs and catalog sources (as described in the earlier sections), some additional steps are necessary above
what was done when installing {product-title} release 2.4 or earlier, as described below.

=== Update your procedures for populating the mirror catalog

If, when installing {product-title} release 2.4, you mirroring procedures created a full copy of
the Red Hat Operators catalog, no special updates to your mirroring proecreus are required other
than refreshing your catalog to pick up the updated content for the new operator releases.

If, on the other hand, your procedures populated mirror catalog that is a filtered catalog,
you will need to update your mirroring procedures to ensure that the `multcluster-engine`
operator package is included in the mirror catalog in addition to
the `advanced-cluster-management` package.
Topic TODO:Need link to disconnect-include-acm-pkgs in install file
provides examples of the options to use when populting the mirror catalog.
Update the operator-package lists used in your procedures to match these new requirements.

=== Update your MutliclusterHub resource instance

As described in the topic
<<disconnect-install-op-and-hub,Install the RHACM operator and Hub>>
above, a new annotation is required on the `MulticlusterHub` resource
when the Hub is being installd or upgraded in a disconnected environment.

For the smoothest upgrade experience, Red Hat recommends that you update your `MulticlusterHub` resource instance
to include the needed annotation before you change the OLM update channel in your OLM subscription
to the `advanced-cluster-management` operator package to trigger the upgrade from release 2.4.
Making this update first allows the upgrade to proceed without delay once initiated.

Use the `oc edit` command to update your `Multiclusterub` resource to add the `mce-subscription-spec` annotation
as shown in this example:

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
   annotations:
      installer.open-cluster-management.io/mce-subscription-spec: '{"source": "<my-mirror-catalog-source>"}'
----

Replace <my-mirror-catalog-source> shown in this example with the name of the `CatalogSource` resource
(in the `openshift-marketplace` namespace) for your mirror catalog.

If you trigger an upgrade from release 2.4 to release 2.5 before mating this upgrade, the upgrade will begin
but then stall at the point the operator attempts to install a subscription to `multicluster-engine` under the covers.
The status of the `MulitclusterHub` resource will continue to show status `Upgrading` when this occurs.
However, this situation can be corrected, and the upgrade completed by using `oc edit` to add the
`mce-subscription-spec` annocation as shown above.
